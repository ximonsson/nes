NES Emulator

## Depedencies

To install the test application libsdl2, libpulse-simple and libGL are needed.

## Installation

`make`

## TODO

* audio bug (Super Mario Bros. if fireworks go off at end of level, sound effects are gone, probably loading of DMC samples)
* some glitches between nametables during scrolling
* more mapper support
* battery support (SRAM)
* saving/loading games (outside battery support)
* code always needs to be cleaned up somewhere
